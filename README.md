Heya!
I'm @theyetch (really just Yetch, but that name was taken ;w;). I don't really code, so I mostly just use Github to mess around and to download things.
I'd like to learn how to to tech stuff though, it's always really interested me. Sadly though, I seem to lack the patience and initiative.
The best place to reach me is through Discord (Yetch#7667), but I'm also on Twitter (@Yetch_) and, rarely, Tumblr (@theyetch).
Well, bye!
